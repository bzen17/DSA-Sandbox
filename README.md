## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are essential topics for any programmer. This repository aims to provide clear and efficient solutions to a wide range of DSA problems. The solutions are implemented in two popular programming languages, Java and Python, allowing you to choose your preferred language or learn both.

## DSA Topics

- Arrays 
- Binary Search
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Sorting
- Stack and Queue
- Trees
- HashMap
- Heap

## Java Solutions

The Java solutions can be found in the [Java](./Java/src) directory. Each problem is organized in its own folder as per below DSA Topics:

- [Arrays](./Java/src/Arrays/)
- [Binary Search](./Java/src/BinarySearch/)
- [Recursion and Backtracking](./Java/src/RecurssionBacktracking/)


## Python Solutions

The Python solutions can be found in the [Python](./Python) directory. Similar to the Java solutions, each problem is organized in its own folder as per below DSA Topics:

- [Arrays](./Python/Arrays/)
- [Binary Search](./Python/BinarySearch/)
- [Recursion and Backtracking](./Python/RecurssionBacktracking/)

==All solutions are written in a clean and concise manner, emphasizing readability, efficiency and best time and space complexity.==
