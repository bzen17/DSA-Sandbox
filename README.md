## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are essential topics for any programmer. This repository aims to provide clear and efficient solutions to a wide range of DSA problems. The solutions are implemented in two popular programming languages, Java and Python, allowing you to choose your preferred language or learn both.

## DSA Topics

- Arrays
- Binary Search
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Sorting
- Stack and Queue
- Trees
- HashMap
- Heap

## Java Solutions

The Java solutions can be found in the [Java](./Java/src) directory. Each problem is organized in its own folder and includes a detailed explanation of the problem, the solution implemented in Java, and a corresponding test suite. The Java solutions are well-documented and follow standard coding conventions for better readability.

To access the Java solutions, simply navigate to the [Java](./Java) directory.

## Python Solutions

The Python solutions can be found in the [Python](./Python) directory. Similar to the Java solutions, each problem is organized in its own folder and includes a comprehensive problem description, the Python solution code, and a corresponding test suite. The Python solutions are written in a clean and concise manner, emphasizing readability and efficiency.

To access the Python solutions, simply navigate to the [Python](./Python) directory.
